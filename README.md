# FAI-project
 Project & Design Management for a non-profit company
This repository contains a collaborative data-driven project developed by the Open Stage R&D team for FAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano), a non-profit organization dedicated to the protection and promotion of Italy’s cultural and environmental heritage.

Our team simulated a real-world R&D environment to design and prototype a data-driven product or service tailored for FAI's needs

This report is organized into three main sections:

User Research and Needs Identification: This section details the methods used to identify target users, understand their needs, and formulate need hypotheses. It presents the findings from our research and analysis, providing a foundation for solution development.

Feasibility and Solution Selection: Here, we explore various potential solutions addressing the identified user needs. After evaluating each option, we select the most promising solution based on feasibility and alignment with user requirements.

Pretotyping and Validation: Finally, we test the selected solution using pretotyping methods to gather preliminary data. This allows us to compare the results against initial expectations and assess the solution’s effectiveness and potential for real-world application.
